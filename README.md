# SPOILER ALERT
Don't go further if you have not solved the puzzles yet, but intent to solve them by yourself. This repo contains solutions and answers to the challenges. You have been warned!

# My Advent of Code 2019
This repo contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges. I will try to document my thoughts and steps on how I solved each puzzle as much as I can.
I will use mainly C# and my goal is to train myself in using all the new features of the language and strengthen my knowledge and usage of best practices in the language and .NET in general.

## Project Hierarchy
I will create a new solution for each day in it's on folder. The solutions will contain 2 projects, one project per puzzle.
A readme for the documention can be found in the DayX folder for each day.
