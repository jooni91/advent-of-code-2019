# SPOILER ALERT
If you have not checked out the puzzles at [https://adventofcode.com/](https://adventofcode.com/) yourself, go and try to solve the puzzles first at your own. This repo contains solutions to the puzzles. You have been warned. Solving the puzzles at your own is much more fun!

# My Advent of Code 2019
This repo contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2019 challenges. I will try to document my thoughts and steps on how I solved each puzzle as much as I can.
I will use mainly C# and my goal is to train myself in using all the new features of the language and strengthen my knowledge and usage of best practices in the language and .NET in general.

## Project Hierarchy
I will create a new solution for each day in it's on folder. The solutions will contain 2 projects, one project per puzzle.
A readme for the documention can be found in the DayX folder for each day.

Links to each day for fast access:
